- [2025-09-23T00:00:01Z] index.html — Switch asset paths to relative (./styles.css, ./script.js) to ensure CSS/JS load when opening file directly without a server.

- [2025-09-25T00:00:08Z] styles.css — Center section content on small screens and narrow container padding so mobile layout stays centered while lists remain readable.
